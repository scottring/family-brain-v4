# Future Enhancements

This document tracks potential features and improvements for the Family Brain application that are currently deemed too complex, risky, or lower priority for immediate implementation. These ideas should be revisited as the core application stabilizes and matures.

## Priority Levels

- **游댮 High Complexity** - Significant architectural changes or complex state management required
- **游리 Medium Complexity** - Moderate development effort with some risk
- **游릭 Low Complexity** - Straightforward implementation with minimal risk

## Risk Assessment

- **Breaking Risk** - Could break existing functionality
- **Performance Risk** - Could impact application performance
- **UX Risk** - Could complicate user experience
- **Data Risk** - Could affect data integrity

---

## SOPs and Templates

### 1. Nested/Embedded SOPs (游댮 High Complexity)

**Description:**  
Allow SOPs (templates) to reference and execute other SOPs as steps within them. This would enable hierarchical procedure composition where complex routines can include sub-routines.

**Use Case Example:**  
A "Morning Routine" SOP could include a step that says "Execute: Review Expected Behavior with Caleb" which would seamlessly launch another complete SOP within the context of the morning routine.

**Current Workaround:**  
Users can manually add a note step saying "Run the 'Expected Behavior' checklist" and manually navigate to that SOP.

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Add new step type: 'template' or 'sop_reference'
- Store referenced template ID in step metadata
- Manage execution context stack (parent/child relationships)
- Track completion state across nested templates
- Handle UI presentation (inline vs modal vs split view)

**Risks:**
- **Breaking Risk**: Circular references could cause infinite loops
- **Performance Risk**: Deep nesting could impact load times
- **UX Risk**: Complex state management for users to understand
- **Data Risk**: Deleted templates referenced by others

**Alternative Simpler Approaches:**
1. **Related SOPs Links** - Add a "Related" section to templates with clickable links
2. **Template Groups** - Group related templates together visually
3. **Copy Steps** - Allow copying steps from one template to another
4. **Template Inheritance** - Create child templates that inherit parent steps

**Implementation Notes:**
```typescript
// Potential step type addition
export type StepType = 'task' | 'note' | 'decision' | 'resource' | 'reference' | 'template'

// Metadata structure for template reference
interface TemplateStepMetadata {
  referenced_template_id?: string
  inline_execution?: boolean
  auto_expand?: boolean
}
```

### 2. Template Versioning and History (游리 Medium Complexity)

**Description:**  
Track changes to templates over time, allowing users to view history and potentially revert changes.

**Use Case:**  
User accidentally deletes important steps or wants to see how a routine has evolved over time.

**Risks:**
- **Data Risk**: Storage requirements increase
- **UX Risk**: Complex UI for version management

---

### 3. Template Sharing Between Families (游리 Medium Complexity)

**Description:**  
Allow families to share their templates with other families, creating a community library of best practices.

**Use Case:**  
A family creates an excellent "First Day of School" routine and wants to share it with friends.

**Risks:**
- **Data Risk**: Privacy and content moderation concerns
- **Breaking Risk**: Cross-family data references

---

## Planning and Scheduling

### 4. Smart Schedule Suggestions (游댮 High Complexity)

**Description:**  
AI-powered suggestions for optimal template placement based on family patterns and preferences.

**Use Case:**  
System suggests moving bedtime routine earlier based on wake-up times and sleep duration goals.

**Risks:**
- **Performance Risk**: AI processing requirements
- **UX Risk**: Users may find suggestions intrusive

---

### 5. Recurring Template Schedules (游리 Medium Complexity)

**Description:**  
Automatically schedule templates to repeat on certain days/times without manual dragging.

**Use Case:**  
"Soccer Practice Prep" automatically appears every Tuesday and Thursday at 3 PM.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Extend recurrence pattern system
- Add template scheduling rules
- Handle conflicts and exceptions

---

## Collaboration Features

### 6. Real-time Collaborative Editing (游댮 High Complexity)

**Description:**  
Multiple family members can edit templates and schedules simultaneously with live updates.

**Use Case:**  
Parents coordinating schedule changes in real-time from different locations.

**Risks:**
- **Breaking Risk**: Conflict resolution complexity
- **Performance Risk**: WebSocket/real-time infrastructure needed

---

### 7. Assignment and Delegation System (游리 Medium Complexity)

**Description:**  
Assign specific templates or steps to family members with notifications.

**Use Case:**  
Assign "Pack Lunch" to rotating family members each day.

**Current State:**  
Basic assignee_type exists but no notification system.

---

## Analytics and Insights

### 8. Completion Analytics Dashboard (游릭 Low Complexity)

**Description:**  
Track and visualize template completion rates, timing patterns, and family participation.

**Use Case:**  
See which routines are consistently completed vs. skipped, identify bottlenecks.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Aggregate template_instance_steps completion data
- Create dashboard components
- Add chart/graph visualizations

---

### 9. Time Tracking and Optimization (游리 Medium Complexity)

**Description:**  
Track actual time spent on routines vs. estimated, suggest optimizations.

**Use Case:**  
Morning routine scheduled for 45 minutes but consistently takes 60 minutes.

---

## Mobile and Cross-Platform

### 10. Native Mobile Applications (游댮 High Complexity)

**Description:**  
iOS and Android apps for better mobile experience and offline capability.

**Considerations:**
- React Native vs. native development
- Offline sync strategy
- Push notifications

---

### 11. Offline Mode with Sync (游댮 High Complexity)

**Description:**  
Allow app to work offline and sync when connection restored.

**Risks:**
- **Data Risk**: Conflict resolution for concurrent offline edits
- **Breaking Risk**: Complex sync logic

---

## Import/Export and Integrations

### 12. Calendar Integration (游리 Medium Complexity)

Sync with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook for external visibility.

**Use Case:**  
Family schedule appears in parents' work calendars for planning.

Export templates to JSON/CSV for backup or sharing via file.

**Implementation Notes:**
```typescript
// Simple export format
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "template": {
    "title": "Morning Routine",
    "steps": [...]
  }
}
```

## Enhanced Features

### 14. Conditional Steps (游리 Medium Complexity)

**Description:**  
Steps that only appear based on conditions (day of week, weather, previous step completion).

**Use Case:**  
"Pack rain jacket" only appears if weather forecast shows rain.

---

### 15. Template Marketplace (游댮 High Complexity)

**Description:**  
Curated library of expert-created templates for various situations.

## Notes

- Features should be re-evaluated quarterly based on user feedback and core stability
- Consider user surveys before implementing high-complexity features
- Always maintain backwards compatibility when implementing new features
- Document migration paths for any data structure changes
