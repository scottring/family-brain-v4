# Family Brain V4 - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Product Name**: Family Brain V4 - Dual-Mode Productivity System  
**Project Type**: Complete greenfield development  
**Target Launch**: Q1 2026 (12-16 weeks development)  
**Core Mission**: Create a bulletproof productivity system that seamlessly balances individual achievement with family coordination through line-item template execution

### Product Vision
Family Brain V4 represents a fundamental shift from traditional task management to **execution-first productivity**. Rather than another planning application, we're building a system where users spend their daily time in actionable, checkbox-driven templates that connect to larger goals while enabling real-time family coordination.

### Market Opportunity
The productivity software market is saturated with planning tools but lacks execution-focused solutions that serve both individual and family contexts. Current solutions force users to choose between personal productivity (Notion, Todoist) or family coordination (Cozi, Google Calendar) without seamless integration between the two modes.

**Target Market Size**: 
- Primary: Tech-savvy families with productivity-conscious parents (2.5M US households)
- Secondary: Individual professionals seeking family-aware productivity (15M users)
- Tertiary: Small teams wanting shared execution visibility (500K teams)

## Core Product Concept

### The 50/50 Dual-Mode System
Family Brain V4 is architected as a balanced system serving two equal use cases:

**Individual Productivity Mode (50%)**
- Personal goals, projects, and tasks management
- Private line-item templates and execution tracking
- Individual planning sessions and analytics
- Personal achievement and progress insights

**Family Collaboration Mode (50%)**
- Shared family goals and coordinated projects
- Collaborative template sharing and execution
- Real-time coordination and status visibility
- Family planning sessions and collective decision making

### Planning Hierarchy
The system follows a clear four-level hierarchy:

```
Goals → Projects → Tasks → Line-Item Templates
```

**Goals**: High-level aspirations (personal or family)  
**Projects**: Concrete initiatives that advance goals  
**Tasks**: Specific work items within projects  
**Templates**: Actionable checklists (5-20 items) that execute tasks  

### Daily Itinerary: The Primary Execution Interface
The daily itinerary is the **primary daily interface** where users spend their time, with line-item templates as executable components within the schedule:

**Daily Itinerary Structure**:
- Time-blocked daily schedule showing all assigned templates
- Visual timeline with templates positioned at specific times
- Real-time progress tracking across all daily templates
- Family visibility into each other's daily schedules
- Context-aware theming throughout the daily view

**Line-Item Templates: The Execution Engine**
Templates serve as executable components within the daily itinerary:
- 5-20 specific, actionable line items per template
- Each item has checkbox, description, optional time estimate
- Templates executed within the context of daily schedule
- Manual assignment from weekly planning to daily itinerary slots
- Real-time completion tracking updates the daily view

**Daily Execution Flow**:
1. **Daily Itinerary View**: See full day with all assigned templates
2. **Template Execution**: Click template to enter focused execution mode
3. **Progress Tracking**: Complete line items within template interface
4. **Return to Itinerary**: Template completion updates daily view
5. **Family Coordination**: Family members see real-time daily progress

**Template Examples Within Daily Context**:
- "7:00 AM - Morning Routine" (Personal): Wake up → Hydrate → Meditate → Priorities → Shower → Breakfast
- "2:00 PM - Client Proposal Work" (Work): Research → Outline → Draft → Review → Format → Send  
- "5:30 PM - Family Dinner Prep" (Family): Menu planning → Shopping → Prep → Cook → Serve → Cleanup
